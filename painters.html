                        <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Leonardo da Vinci</span> (1452-1519) was an Italian Renaissance artist, architect, engineer, and scientist. 
                        He is renowned for his ability to observe and capture nature, scientific phenomena, and human emotions in all media. 
                        Leonardo’s innovative masterpieces demonstrate a mastery of light, perspective, and overall effect. 
                        His most-loved works include the Mona Lisa portrait and The Last Supper mural.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speech">
                        Considered one of the greatest minds in history, Leonardo's approach to acquiring knowledge on everything from anatomy to mechanics 
                        involved understanding both the theory and practice of any given subject. In short, by combining the skills of the artisan with those of the scholar, 
                        Leonardo's vision demonstrated the benefits of a completely new approach to understanding the present world and just how to best create new and 
                        marvellous things for a future one.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speech">
                        Leonardo was far from being restricted to art and his interests were wide indeed, encompassing just about all the physical world. 
                        He studied architecture, engineering, geometry, perspective, mechanics, and hydraulics to satisfy himself just how things worked and 
                        why they appeared as they do to the human eye. The natural world was not neglected with studies in anatomy, botany, zoology, and geology. 
                        Leonardo kept notebooks throughout his life in which he recorded the results of his investigations and his ideas for new inventions. 
                        Machines the artist conjured up include cranes, paddlewheel boats, tanks, cannons, apparatus to breathe underwater, and even flying contraptions. 
                        The only element many of these designs lacked was an internal combustion engine, not to be invented, of course, until centuries later. 
                        The notes in these books are often interspersed with sketches, many being miniature masterpieces in themselves. 
                        Perhaps the most famous of all these sketches is the Vitruvian Man drawing.

                        <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Sandro Botticelli</span>(1445-1510 CE), real name Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi, 
                        was an Italian artist of the early Renaissance. A prolific painter, especially of altarpieces and works with a religious theme, 
                        Botticelli's most famous work today is, ironically, the mythological Birth of Venus which is now on display in the Uffizi Gallery 
                        of his native Florence. Widely regarded as one of the greatest painters in Western art, Botticelli blended colour, form, 
                        and perspective to produce religious and secular works with outstanding visual poetry. Reinterpreting and intertwining traditional 
                        imagery from classical mythology and Christian art, his paintings are often open to multiple interpretations.
                    </p>
                    <p class="speech">
                        The artist was popular and mixed public works with private commissions, especially for the powerful Medici family of Florence. 
                        For the latter, Botticelli explored many themes from Roman and Greek mythology such as the Primavera. Between 1480 and 1484 CE, 
                        Botticelli produced perhaps his most famous work, the Birth of Venus. Religious works were not abandoned and he attracted the admiration 
                        of Pope Sixtus IV (r. 1471-1484 CE) who commissioned Botticelli to decorate a part of the interior of the Sistine Chapel in Rome in the early 1480s CE. 
                        The chapel benefitted from the attention of many great artists, and Botticelli was given a lower wall space to show scenes from the Old Testament,
                        which include the Life of Moses panel and a remarkably accurate depiction of Rome's Arch of Constantine.
