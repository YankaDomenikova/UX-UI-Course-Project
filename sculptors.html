                        <span class="fw-bold fs-5">Donatello</span> (c. 1386-1466 CE), full name Donato di Niccolo di Betto Bardi, 
                        was an Italian Renaissance artist best known for his sculptures such as the striking bronze figure of David now 
                        in the Bargello museum of his native Florence. Donatello was influential in popularising the classicizing style 
                        where Renaissance artists looked to the surviving works of antiquity for inspiration. The sculptor was particularly 
                        interested in giving his art a sense of perspective. Other works by Donatello which influenced later artists include 
                        his marble Saint Mark for the Orsanmichele in Florence, the shallow bronze relief panels for both the baptistery of Sienna 
                        and the altar of Sant' Antonio Basilica in Padua, and the Gattamelata equestrian statue in Padua.

                        Donatello was particularly interested in both classical sculpture and linear perspective and both of these approaches influenced other 
                        Florentine artists in the 15th century CE during the opening phase of the Renaissance known as the quattrocento. Technically accomplished 
                        and innovative, Donatello's work was particularly admired in his own lifetime. His relief panels were praised for their use of perspective 
                        even if they were carved with a shallow depth, a technique known as 'flattened relief' or rilievo schiacciato. Additionally, by moving between Rome, 
                        Florence, and Padua, Donatello spread new ideas on perspective construction to fellow artists such as Andrea Mantegna (c. 1431-1506 CE). Meanwhile, 
                        Donatello's figure sculptures were famous for their lively and twisting bodies (figura serpentinata) which invite the viewer to explore different 
                        views of the work by walking around it. Another strength of the master sculptor was the expressiveness of his statues' faces.
